Kristiana P.I see that you have 2 active hosting plans with us:

FastCloud - mimallgh.com
FastCloud Plus - ghfarmgate.com

FastCloud allows the hosting of only 1 domain, meaning that you will be able to add more domains under your FastCloud Plus only.

That being said, in order to host a new domain name to your "FastCloud Plus - ghfarmgate.com" plan, you should take the following 2 steps:
Markowkay Madam, am following please


Kristiana P.1) go to cPanel > Addon Domains, and add the new domain name (which will create a directory for it so it works as a separate website). Here's also a guide with screenshots you can refer to:

> https://www.fastcomet.com/tutorials/cpanel/addon-domains

2) you will also need to point your domain name to the nameservers of your hosting plan, which are:

ns1.s10.fcomet.com
ns2.s10.fcomet.com

That can be done from the place your domain is registered.

Please bear in mind that nameserver change doesn't come into effect immediately, meaning that it may take from a few minutes to a few hours until the new nameservers apply and your new domain starts resolving to our server.
MarkPlease the new domain name must have been purchased freshly right?


Kristiana P.That is of no importance - it's only vital that the domain is active at the moment
MarkI meant to say, i need to buy a new domain name and then add it to my host as an Addon?


Kristiana P.Yes, that is correct
MarkOwkay Madam

i will follow your steps

Thanks Madam


Kristiana P.Most welcome!
Mark:)
